								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>I chose Computer Science because I love to create things. Ever since I was a little kid, I was always on the computer working on small little programs, games, and animations. This passion made my choice to go into Computer Science very easy.
								</p>
								<p>This passion carried me through my time at UMD where I truly got to expand my knowledge. I studied new programming languages, algorithms, and technologies all with the same love I had for it as when I was a kid. It was also in this time where I got my first experience in the industry with my internship at Dell. The experience I had there was incredible, and I learned more than I thought I ever would. Working with a team of experienced developers really showed me what working in that kind of environment was like. I dug deep into things such as C#, SQL, and Node.js. I also learned about the Agile development process with things like Kanban. I learned so much from my summer there, and I couldn't wait to learn more.</p>
								<p>My other work experience has given me another set of useful skills. Lifeguarding and being a barista are very customer facing environments, meaning you are always interacting with people and on your feet. My work at a cabinet shop really showed me what hard work was like, and how rewarding it can be when you try your best.
								</p>
								<p>Now, working as a Software Engineer, the passion to learn and create remains with me. I have learned so much up to this point, but there is still so much to explore.</p>
